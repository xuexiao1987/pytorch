# Note [OpInfos]
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The majority of this note was written shortly after the PyTorch 1.9 release.
# If you notice it's out-of-date or think it could be improved then please
# file an issue.
#
# See also: the OpInfo tracker (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/54261)
# See also: "Writing Test Templates" in common_device_type.py to learn how to

#
# An OpInfo is a collection of metadata related to a PyTorch operator. This
#   metadata is used to generate tests that validate properties of the operator,
#   like if it implements the correct gradient formula.
#
# WHY OPINFOS?
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# OpInfos are principally intended to do three things:
#
#   1) to allow systematic testing over all PyTorch's operators
#   2) to simplify operating testing by autogenerating many tests
#   3) to allow systems (like autograd, torchscript, fx, nnc...) to test
#        against every PyTorch operator
#
# All these goals are still a work in progress. Not every operator has an
#   OpInfo, and some operator tests that could be automatically generated
#   still have to be written manually.
#
# It's helpful to understand that OpInfos are both about test simplification and
#   modularity. PyTorch is a complicated framework with many interrelated systems,
#   too many for any one person to keep track of. An OpInfo can be thought of as the
#   interface between an operator implementer and those other systems. Instead of
#   requiring the implementer of torch.foo understand how to test its forward
#   mode AD or NNC support that's typically handled automatically just by
#   defining an OpInfo.
#
# It's often surprising to OpInfo writers that just implementing an OpInfo
#   typically can't verify an operator is actually implemented correctly:
#
# "If an OpInfo doesn't validate my op works as expected, what's the point
#     of it?"
#
# But the point of is the above. OpInfos are intended to let you focus on testing
#   the operator logic you're familiar with instead of having to write tests for
#   how the operator interacts with each of PyTorch's many systems.
#
# And, OK, it turns out that SOMETIMES just writing an OpInfo DOES
#   validate your op works as expected, but that's only in special
#   cases. See below for details.
#
# WHAT'S AN OPINFO?
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# So what is an OpInfo? It's a Python class that describes an operator's properties,
#   like which dtypes it supports on the CPU and whether it has any aliases.
#   These properties can be divided into three categories:
#
#   1) Metadata describing the operator, like the operator's name and if it
#     "supports" the out kwarg.
#   2) Test directives, like "skips" that tell the test suite to skip some
#     tests.
#   3) A "sample inputs" function that generates valid inputs for the operator.
#
# OpInfo attributes are described in more detail below.
#
# THE SAMPLE INPUTS FUNCTION
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The "sample inputs" function merits special elaboration. This function is
#   crucial to testing with OpInfos. A typical OpInfo test has to treat the operator
#   as a black box. There's no structure for the test to understand or exploit.
#   Without "sample inputs" it wouldn't even know how to call the OpInfo's
#   operator. The sample input function saves the day by providing different
#   "SampleInputs" that can be used to call the operator. A sample input
#   function should have the following signature:
#
#   def sample_inputs_foo(op_info, device, dtype, requires_grad, **kwargs):
#
#   And should return an iterable of SampleInputs (see the class description
#   above). Each SampleInput defines an "input", "args", "kwargs", an
#   "output_process_fn_grad" function, the "broadcasts_input" bool and a
#   "name".
#
#   All the "sample_inputs" functions are invoked within a `torch.no_grad()`
#   environment for efficiency and correctness. As such remember to set the
#   "requires_grad" flag on the inputs **after** performing any transformations
#   on them.
#
# The "input" is the first argument to the operator, or the tensor that
#   the method or inplace variants of the operator should be called on, and
#   should be on the requested device, of the requested dtype, and its
#   requires_grad attribute should be set to the requires_grad argument.
#
# "args" should contain positional arguments, and "kwargs" keyword arguments.
#
# "output_process_fn_grad" has an interesting name. It's a function that maps
#   the operator's output (when given the input, args, and kwargs) to the
#   portion of the output to gradcheck. For example, consider an operator
#   like torch.linalg.slogdet
#   (https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.linalg.slogdet.html).
#   This operator returns a tuple of two tensors, but the first tensor
#   cannot be backwarded through. Its "output_process_fn_grad" filters
#   this output tuple to just the second argument, which we can call backward
#   on. Functions that produce a single tensor can ignore this argument.
#
# "broadcasts_input" is a bool indicated if the SampleInput causes the operator
#   to broadcast the "input" argument. This is important for tests to understand
#   because inplace variants of operations throw a runtime error if they
#   would broadcast their input arguments, so tests that work with inplace
#   variants filter SampleInputs that broadcast their input.
#
# "name" is a string that's just used for debugging. It appears when printing
#   the SampleInput.
#
# Sample inputs are designed to be used with many tests, some
#   that are very time consuming, so they should be a small
#   set with small tensors. An elaborated set of sample inputs
#   can be specified using the "reference_inputs_func" attribute.
#   The "reference inputs" for an operation are an extended
#   set of sample inputs that can more exhausively test an
#   operator. They are used by only a few tests that are careful
#   not to take too long to run. Adding reference inputs
#   is highly encouraged!
#
# THE (OPTIONAL) ERROR INPUTS FUNCTION
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# OpInfos may optionally specify "error inputs" through an error function. If
#   specified test_errors in test_ops.py will call the op with these inputs
#   and validate that the desired error is thrown.
#
# Error inputs automate a common testing pattern where multiple inputs are
#   passed to an operation and the errors they thrown are reviewed. Tests
#   written in this style should be ported to the new OpInfo pattern.
#
# Error inputs are specified using the ErrorInputs class, which contains
#   a SampleInput (see above) and data about the expected error.
#
# OPINFO FILE ORGANIZATION
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# All OpInfos are currently defined in this file. Most OpInfo tests are defined
#   in test_ops.py, but some system-specific tests are defined in those
#   systems' test files, and subclass-specific tests are defined in the test
#   file that corresponds to that subclass (see the below).
#   Expect a reorganization in the future.
#
# WHAT'S TESTED?
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Every OpInfo in the op_db sequence has the following properties validated in
# test_ops.py:
#
#   - that its supported dtypes are specified correctly
#   - that the operation produces the same results when called with noncontiguous inputs
#   - that it supports the out= argument properly (if it allows out=),
#       see https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Developer-FAQ#how-does-out-work-in-pytorch
#   - that it works with the conjugate view bit properly
#   - that its function, method, and inplace variants perform the same operation
#       (that is, that torch.add, torch.Tensor.add, and torch.Tensor.add_ all
#       do the same thing).
#   - that its inplace variant preserves the input's storage
#   - that its gradient formula is implemented correctly, and that it supports
#       gradgrad and complex grad and gradgrad and forward mode AD properly for
#       the op's function and inplace variants (method variants are skipped
#       to reduce test time).
#   - that the operation performs the same operation when traced or scripted
#       using the jit
#   - that the operation is autodifferentiated by the jit as expected
#   - that the operator's aliases, if any, perform the same operation and that
#       the jit understands the alias
#   - that the operator throws the correct errors (if error_inputs is defined)
#   - that the operator produces the same results as a NumPy reference (if ref is defined)
#   - that the operator produces the same results as a NumPy reference on an extended
#       set of "reference inputs" (if both ref and reference_inputs_func are defined)
#       (NOTE: elementwise unary and elementwise binary OpInfos do this even if only
#         ref is defined, because they effectively autogenerate reference inputs)
#   - that the operator works on different CUDA devices
#
# Additional OpInfo tests are in test_jit_fuser_te.py, test_fx_experimental.py,
#   and test_fx.py. These tests validate that operators work with NNC and FX
#   as expected.
#
# For performance, some of the above tests may only run on the first
#   SampleInput returned by an OpInfo's sample input function.
#
# In addition to these tests, some subclasses (discussed in the next section)
#   define additional tests.
#
# Critically, as mentioned above, what's not necessarily tested is that the operator
#   works as expected. When implementing an OpInfo an engineer must still
#   typically write one or more tests validating the operator's behavior.
#   The exception to this is if reference testing is sufficient, or if
#   the operation belongs to an OpInfo subclass that has more exhaustive
#   operator testing. Elementwise unary and elementwise binary operators,
#   in particular, usually don't require additional testing beyond
#   writing an Opinfo.
#
#
# OPINFO (SUB)CLASSES
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# In addition to the OpInfo base class there are several specialized OpInfo
#   subclasses. For example, the UnaryUfuncInfo subclass is used for
#   unary elementwise operations. These operations have a common structure
#   that test_unary_ufuncs.py exploits with additional automated testing.
#   The automated testing in test_unary_ufuncs.py is so thorough, comparing
#   the operator to a NumPy reference function on a plethora of values, that
#   just implementing an OpInfo for a unary elementwise operation is often
#   sufficient testing.
#
# The ForeachFuncInfo is another OpInfo subclass that is hyper-specialized to a
#   very unique class of operations. These OpInfos aren't included in the
#   op_db sequence and have their own tests.
#
# Other OpInfo subclasses, like SpectralFuncInfo, are just for convenience
# when writing OpInfos.
#
# TESTING A NEW OPERATOR
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# If you're adding a new operator to any of the following namespaces:
#   - torch
#   - torch.fft
#   - torch.linalg,
#   - torch.special
#   - torch.nn.functional
# then you should typically add an OpInfo for it.
#
# As mentioned a couple times above, implementing an OpInfo is not
#   usually sufficient testing (unless the operator is a unary or binary elementwise
#   operator). The OpInfo will only test the properties described in the
#   "WHAT'S TESTED" section. It DOES NOT necessarily verify that the operator is
#   implemented correctly.
#
# TIPS FOR WRITING AN OPINFO AND OPINFO TESTS
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Writing an OpInfo can be a little daunting. Since the point of an OpInfo is to
#   be consumed by a variety of systems it can be hard to understand how to
#   deal with test failures or how to set the OpInfo metadata properly.
#
# Before adding an OpInfo it helps to look at other OpInfos. A sample inputs
#   function must be defined, and the operator's dtypes must be specified.
#   Once that's done you should run the operator's tests in test_ops.py
#   (these can be filtered using the "-k" argument in pytest). Tests that
#   fail should provide an error message that describes what to change about
#   your OpInfo. You don't need to worry about changing an OpInfo's default
#   values unless a test yells at you.
#
# Similarly, if you're writing a test that consumes OpInfos then it's critical
#   your test provides a clear error message describing what to do when it
#   fails. You should not assume the OpInfo implementer is familiar with your
#   system.
#
# If you see a confusing error message while developing an OpInfo then please
#   file an issue describing what happened.
#
# This trial-and-error approach to writing an OpInfo can be frustrating,
#   but it's probably necessary as long as OpInfos don't require
#   learning about all the systems that consume them. One thing that can help
#   is the get_supported_dtypes() function defined in utils.py. This
#   function can be used to programmatically specify the dtypes an operator
#   supports, and is especially useful if writing an OpInfo on a machine
#   without a CUDA device. See its documentation for more details.

# NOTE [Python References]
# Python References emulate existing PyTorch operations, but can ultimately
#   be expressed in terms of "primitive" operations from torch._prims.
#
# These references are experimental.
# See https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/tracing-with-primitives-update-0/577
#   for additional context.
#
# Python Reference OpInfos should be added to the python_ref_db list below.
#   Tests can opt-into running on these references by including
#   that list in the Sequence they pass to the @ops decorator.
#
# When a Python Reference OpInfo is constructed a pointer to an
#   existing OpInfo must be provided using the torch_opinfo_name kwarg.
#   The existing OpInfo with that name and no variant will be found
#   to inherit from.
#
# Instead of just inheriting the existing OpInfo's metadata, the
#   Python Reference OpInfos inherit the existing OpInfo's
#   construction arguments. These arguments can be overridden
#   by adding kwargs to the constructor.
